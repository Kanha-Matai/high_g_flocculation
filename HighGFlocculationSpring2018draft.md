## Abstract
Previously, the High G team designed an experimental setup to test the effects of velocity gradient on flocculator performance. Specifically the team sought to determine an optimal G value through effluent turbidity results.

For this semester, the team aspires to continue to conduct experiments to conclude on an optimal G value. Additionally, the team seeks to evaluate the use of hydrophobic tubing to minimize headloss, assess whether headloss can be mitigate through a sudden, short increase in pump speed, and overall to determine a relationship between coagulant dose and optimal G. As of now, our team has concluded that hydrophobic tubing does not significantly mitigate headloss.

## Introduction
Flocculation is the water treatment process in which particles, which have had their charges neutralized through coagulation, are prompted to collide and aggregate with other particles to form flocs. The intention is that once these flocs conglomerate, they will settle out due to gravity during sedimentation. A driving factor in the formation of these flocs is from particle shear in the flocculator. For our specific experimental setup, flocs are solely composed of clay particles and coagulant (PACl). A fraction of the surface of the clay particles is covered in coagulant and when these particles are prompted to collide, a successful collision occurs due to electrostatic attraction: the positively charged coagulant particle neutralizes the negatively charged clay particle. The likelihood of such collisions to occur increases when particles scatter around at different velocities, hence a flocculator subjects flow to a specific velocity gradient.

Last semester, the High G team measured the pressure increase through the flocculator of one trial at 300 Hz and 1.4 mg/L coagulant.

The pressure throughout the flocculator increased about 12 cm in 10 hours. The change in effluent turbidity throughout did not change. Prior research from the High Rate Sedimentation research team has indicated that at higher upflow velocity in the sedimentation tank, the floc blanket will decay and the effluent turbidity increases throughout a similar experimental trial, likely from the increase in pressure in the flocculator.

The High G Flocculation team hypothesizes that coagulant buildup in the flocculator is the main contributor towards the observed increase in pressure different throughout the flocculator.



## Methods
MEHRIN
Flocculator design parameters were determined through MatCAD and sedimentation design parameters were based on values dervied from the High Rate Sedimentation Summer 2017 team. These values are tabulated below.

Overall, the experimental setup consists of a flocculator, clay and coagulant reservoirs, tube settler, and five distinct pumps. Tabulated below is a summary of the experimental materials and their respective functions.

A pressure sensor is incorporated into our experimental (located at the inlet and outlet of the flocculator) to assess whether the water and flocculator pumps are maintaining constant pressure during each trail. Additionally, a pressure attenuator is incorporated into our setup (located between the water pump and influent turbidimeter),

## Results and Analysis

###**Hydrophobic vs Regular Tubing**
When conducting the experiment comparing the headloss in identical experiments with solely changing the tubing from regular tubing to hydrophobic tubing we achieved the following results.
![nonhydrophobic]() ![hydrophobic]()
 
From these results we were able to see and insignificant result. In both experiments, the trial started at around 70cm and after 10 hours reached 120cm at a constant rate. This showed that the hydrophobic tubing was inefftive at minimizing headloss due to the coagulant. Hence we begun to test what exactly was causing the pressure build-up, hence we began testing individual components. We first tested just water to ensure this effect is not a mere natural thing caused by water in our system. Hence we ran a trial by running just water through the pipe.

![just water]()

This experiment eliminated the possibility that the pressure build up was caused simply due to the actual set up of this experiment. This was what we hypothesized as whenever we started a new trial, we were able to start at the same pressure everytime. However, we were unable to predict the minute drop in pressure, however, this could attributed to changes in viscosity due to temperature changes throughout the day. We then began testing water with coagulant.

![water+coagulant,regtub]()

Due to some an overnight issue, we were solely able to obtain 3 hours of valuable data for this trial. This experiment surprised us as it was not what we hypothesized.We believed it was the combination of both the coagulant along with the clay that was causing the headloss. Instead, this data shows that the coagulant alone causes the pressure increase. In fact, the pressure increase was even more significant. Within 3 hours, the pressure was able to rise from 70cm to 95cm, which is half the change when run with clay in a third of the time. This experiment was conducted with regular tubing, and hence, to ensure the hydrophobic tubing makes an insignificant difference in headloss, we ran an experiment with hydrophobic tubing too.

*Present an observation (results), then explain what happened (analysis).  Each paragraph should focus on one aspect of your results. In that same paragraph, you should interpret that result.  
In other words, there should not be two distinct paragraphs, but instead one paragraph containing one result and the interpretation and analysis of this result. Here are some guiding questions for results and analysis:

When describing your results, present your data, using the guidelines below:
* What happened? What did you find?
* Show your experimental data in a professional way.*
```python
from aide_design.play import*
x = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
y = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
plt.figure('ax',(10,8))
plt.plot(x,y,'*')
plt.savefig('/Users/jillianwhiting/github/Jillian-Whiting/Images/linear')
plt.show()
```

Figure 1: Captions are very important for figures. Captions go below figures.

After describing a particular result, within a paragraph, go on to connect your work to fundamental physics/chemistry/statics/fluid mechanics, or whatever field is appropriate. Analyze your results and compare with theoretical expectations; or, if you have not yet done the experiments, describe your expectations based on established knowledge. Include implications of your results. How will your results influence the design of AguaClara plants? If possible provide clear recommendations for design changes that should be adopted. Show your experimental data in a professional way using the following guidelines:
* Why did you get those results/data?
* Did these results line up with expectations?
* What went wrong?
* If the data do not support your hypothesis, is there another hypothesis that describes your new data?

## Conclusions
*Explain what you have learned and how that influences your next steps. Why does what you discovered matter to AguaClara?

Make sure that you defend your conclusions with facts and results.*

## Future Work
*Describe your plan of action for the next several weeks of research. Detail the next steps for this team. How can AguaClara use what you discovered for future projects? Your suggestions for challenges for future teams are most welcome. Should research in this area continue?*
